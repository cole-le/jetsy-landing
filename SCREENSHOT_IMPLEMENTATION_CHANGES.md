# Screenshot Implementation Changes

## Overview
Removed the complex screenshot API endpoint and replaced it with a simpler, automatic approach that triggers screenshot capture when someone visits a project's public URL.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Screenshot API Endpoint
- **Deleted**: `POST /api/projects/:id/preview/screenshot` endpoint
- **Deleted**: `captureProjectScreenshot()` function
- **Deleted**: `handlePreviewRoute()` function (was `/preview/:projectId`)
- **Deleted**: Screenshot trigger from `/chat` page

### 2. Added New Project Route
- **New**: `GET /{projectId}` route that serves the project website
- **New**: `handleProjectRoute()` function that:
  - Serves the project HTML
  - Automatically triggers screenshot capture if `preview_image_url` doesn't exist
  - Caches responses for 5 minutes

### 3. Updated Screenshot Function
- **Modified**: `captureAndPersistProjectScreenshot()` function
  - Now takes `projectUrl` instead of `deploymentUrl`
  - Screenshots the project's own URL (e.g., `https://jetsy.dev/123`)
  - Runs in background without blocking the response

### 4. Frontend Changes
- **Removed**: Manual screenshot trigger from `TemplateBasedChat.jsx`
- **Removed**: `screenshotTriggeredRef` state
- **Simplified**: No more manual API calls to trigger screenshots

## How It Works Now

1. **User visits**: `https://jetsy.dev/123`
2. **Worker serves**: The project HTML immediately
3. **Background process**: If no screenshot exists, triggers Cloudflare Browser Rendering
4. **Screenshot stored**: In R2 bucket and URL saved to `projects.preview_image_url`
5. **Community page**: Automatically displays the screenshot when available

## Benefits

- **Simpler**: No complex API coordination
- **Automatic**: Screenshots happen when needed
- **Faster**: Project pages load immediately
- **Reliable**: Screenshots captured from live URLs
- **Efficient**: Only captures when `preview_image_url` is missing

## Testing

- **Local testing**: Limited (Cloudflare Browser Rendering can't access localhost)
- **Live testing**: Use `node test-new-project-route.js` on deployed worker
- **Manual testing**: Visit `https://jetsy.dev/{projectId}` for any project

## Environment Variables Required

- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`: Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token with Browser Rendering permissions
- `IMAGES_BUCKET`: R2 bucket binding for storing screenshots

## Database Schema

The existing `projects` table columns are used:
- `preview_image_url`: Stores the screenshot URL
- `preview_image_updated_at`: Timestamp of last screenshot update

## Migration Notes

- No database changes required
- Existing screenshots continue to work
- New projects automatically get screenshots on first visit
- Old screenshot API calls willg return 404 (as expected)

## **Complete Setup Commands:**

```bash
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

## **What These Secrets Do:**

- **`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`**: Allows the worker to call Cloudflare's Browser Rendering API to capture screenshots
- **`CF_ACCOUNT_ID`**: Identifies which Cloudflare account to use for the API calls

## **After Setting Secrets:**

Once you set these secrets, you'll need to redeploy the worker for them to take effect:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler.worker.toml
```

Then the screenshot capture should work properly when someone visits `https://jetsy.dev/2102202872`!

Would you like me to help you set these secrets now?
